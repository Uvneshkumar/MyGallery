# MyGallery

Wanted to group all your mostly used media files in 1 place? This is the right place to do that. Just share the media that you like from any app to this app, and all your shared media will be stored locally in a separate folder allowing you to easily identify them whenever required.

The app doesn't request Internet permission and hence all your data is stored only in your mobile and never gets leaked ;)

All files will be saved under MyGalleryByBigBrains folder in the root of internal storage.
